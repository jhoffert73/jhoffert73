- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhoffert73
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my skills with languages (Python, lisp, Java, etc) and using them to improve my 30 years of knowledge in Network Engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Terraform, Ansible, Python, and Docker and their application in automating tasks in AWS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who are learning or willing to help instruct so that I can bring my skillset up to speed.
- 📫 You can reach me at jhoffert51@gmail.com.
